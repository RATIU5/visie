# Visie - MVP Specification

## Purpose:

To develop a web-based application that enables multiple users to collaboratively edit and animate video content in real-time.

## Target User:

Content creators, animators, video editors, and any individuals or teams who need to collaboratively edit and animate video content.

## Core Features:

- User Registration & Authentication: Allow users to create an account, log in, and manage their session. For the MVP, this can be a simple username/password setup without any complex profile management.

- Video Upload: Users can upload videos from their device to the platform. For the MVP, support a limited number of common formats like MP4 and MOV.

- Video Playback: Once a video is uploaded, users can view it in the application. Include basic playback controls like play, pause, and seek.

- Basic Video Editing and Animation: Provide a set of basic editing and animation tools for the video:

  - Cut: Trim the video length from the beginning or end.
  - Split: Divide the video into two separate sections at a specified point.
  - Text Overlay: Add simple text to the video at specified time frames.
  - Basic Motion Graphics: Allow users to create simple animations such as moving text or shapes across the screen.

- Real-time Collaboration: Allow multiple users to work on editing and animating a video simultaneously:

  - Shared Viewing: All users can see the current state of the video.
  - Concurrent Editing: Users can see each other's changes in real-time.
